- Use standard section headers like "PROJECTS" or "TECHNICAL PROJECTS"

### **For Recruiter Clarity:**
- Start each bullet with strong action verbs (Accomplished, Delivered, Enhanced, Achieved)
- Quantify impact wherever possible (percentages, timeframes, scale metrics)
- Keep bullets to 1-2 lines maximum
- Group related technologies together
- Prioritize most relevant projects for specific job applications

### **Customization Tips:**
- Tailor project selection based on job requirements
- Emphasize relevant technologies for target roles
- Adjust quantified metrics to highlight most impressive achievements
- Reorder projects based on relevance to specific positions
- Include links to demos/GitHub when space permits (especially for technical roles)
